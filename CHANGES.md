## Next

## 0.7.0

* Add in place update methods to buffers and elements via `buffer.subdata` and `elements.subdata`
* Pool stream buffers
* Rewrite resource section of API, bring individual resources to the top
* Optimized buffer and elements creation, no more memory allocation

## 0.6.0

* Allow for dynamic properties in viewport, scissor box and attributes
* Switch order of arguments to dynamic functions, from (props, context) to (context, props)
    + functions without a props argument become batch static
* Implement non-batch constant context, framebuffer and viewport
* Batched scope rendering
* Switch order of props and context variables for dynamic function args
* function invocation now takes batch id as separate parameter
* Support directly constructing elements and attributes from arrays
* Allow individual attribute properties to be dynamic (eg buffers, offsets, etc.)
* Code generation rewrite
    + State flag polling is now inlined
    + draw and batch inlined for static shaders
    + constants are inlined
    + fewer arguments passed to generated code
    + Stop using separate arrays for stacks to manage state, instead state is saved onto the call stack
* Error reporting
    + All error messages should link to command/resource declaration
    + Improve validation of vertex attributes
    + Improve validation of dynamic properties
* Code quality and contributing
    + Combined lib/state.js and lib/compile.js into lib/core.js
    + Delete most of lib/attribute.js
    + Update development documentation
* Expose limits for shader precision

## 0.5.0

* Context variables
* Use `this` argument effectively
    * Should pass this to dynamic attributes and scope
* Make scopes and dynamic attributes take same argument
* Combine batchId with stats argument
* Pass `this` to draw commands so that they can be stored as members

## 0.4.0

* Circle CI finally passes!
* Use numeric ids instead of strings for shader sources
* Shader error messages are better
* Browserify transform to remove all runtime checks
* Shader linking is deferred until draw call, enables partial shaders in scope
* Report errors for missing attributes, uniforms and vertex count

## 0.3.0

* added renderbuffers (via regl.renderbuffer)
* added framebuffer objects (via regl.framebuffer)
* regl.buffer and regl.elements can now take ndarray-like inputs
* Switch to using Google closure compiler for minified builds

## 0.2.0

* Texture support implemented, but not well tested
* Fix attribute binding bug

## 0.1.0

* Actually kind of works now!
* All draw state and WebGL state except textures, renderbuffers and frame buffers wrapped
* Changed the arguments to dynamic functions.  Now they take (args, batchId, stats) instead of (frameCount, batchId)
* Tons of code generation improvements and bug fixing
* Unit tests!
* Code coverage metrics! (not good yet)
* API docs!

## 0.0.0

* First published to npm
